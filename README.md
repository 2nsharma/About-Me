## Welcome to the About Me Website! 

Hello! My name is Nayana Sharma! I am excited to tlak about myself, so you can know me better!

The school year is soon ending, summer is arriving and finally, my junior year of  high school is coming to a close. A new chapter is opening up in my life, but first -- this website will detail my accomplishments and hobbies-- and more about me!
### Who am I?

My name is Nayana and I am a junior at EBHS high school. I am a perfectionist at heart because I enjoy doing my very best to achieve the highest quality in all kinds of work--whether it be schoolwork or hobbies. But I've been trying to change myself, operating beyond my ego and need for validation from others. I must say that this year has been a rollercoaster, full of highs and lows. Junior year is the time when I have been learning to get in touch with myself.
