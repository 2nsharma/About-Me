Hello! My name is **Nayana Sharma** and I am a junior at EBHS high school! I am excited to talk about myself so you can know me better!

The school year is soon ending, summer is arriving and finally, my junior year of high school is coming to a close. A new chapter is opening up in my life, but first -- this website will detail my accomplishments and hobbies -- and more about me!


###                                                     Who Am I? Some Random Facts!

I am a _perfectionist_ at heart because I enjoy doing my very best to achieve the highest quality in all kinds of work--whether it be schoolwork or hobbies. But I've been trying to change myself, operating beyond my ego and need for validation from others. I must say that this year has been a rollercoaster, full of highs and lows. Junior year is a year when I have been learning to get in touch with myself. 

In other words, I've been trying to reduce my stress, and high expectations and pressure I put on myself, by playing with **my dog, Chikoo.**

This is **my dog Chikoo**, by the way:

His name is based off of an Indian fruit called chikoo, which is brown and fuzzy on the outside, soft in the inside. In a similar manner, my dog has fuzzy fur and is the kindest dog ever. 

I like staying at home with my dog, which is why I am a _homebody_. If anyone asked me about my favorite place in the world, it would be my home. I dislike traveling because of the time away from home, a reason that is important to my life--especially trips involving long car rides and flights via airplanes. At home, when the skies are dark and filled with _rainy clouds_-, the sounds of _thunder rumbling as rain patters across my bedroom windows,_ it is then when I feel like I am at peace with my thoughts and emotions. _I absolutely love rain._  Contrary to the feelings of dreariness, misery, as well as melancholy associated with rain showers, _the truth is that rain is both calming and cooling_.

Speaking about calming things, another weird fact about me is that I have recently gotten into _tarot readings_. I have no clue why, but it is an absolutely soothing activity, especially when hearing someone talk about the possibilities of youu present situation. Tarot reading, while **bogus** for many, is a reminder for me that the power to decide _your future is only within your hands_. It is the sounds of cards being shuffled, nails tapping the tarot cards midst thought, that calm my racing thoughts.

## Social Media Information!
I am only on instagram, and my account name is **'whynotbcihatesnakeu.'** It is a random name I came up with. The "why not" part is based off of my belief that you can do anything if you ask yourself _"why not?"_ The "ihatesnakeu" part is just some silly phrase I put together.

### My Hobbies

-  **Playing Tennis**

I first started playing tennis with my dad when I was six year sold. Since then, I have been playing tennis with him and have learned about the various techniques used. The usual forehands and backhands used don't stand up to my favorite move. My favorite move is called the _slice._ This is when you brush your racket along the side, _effectively changing the spin and bounce of the ball_. 

Here is an example:

-  **Learning songs in different languages!**

I am actually not a fan of American songs for some reason. I am a fan of K-pop, or Korean pop, which is basically music in the Korean language. My favorite boy bands from this genre would be **BTS, and Stray Kids**, who have a wide range of songs that are catchy and actually have touching songs, thought-provoking lyrics, which I look for when listening to music.

-  **Baking cakes and cookies!**

I have gotten into baking different kinds of cakes of varying flavors. I have tried orange cakes, chocolate cakes, pineapple cakes, lemon cakes, red-velvet cakes, strawberry cakes, vanilla cakes so far. I hope to find more time to experiment with other kinds of cakes. Maybe something like a _caramel cake or a blueberry cake--something unique--would be my next baked treat_.

For cookies, I have only tried vanilla, nutmeg, coconut chocolate-chip, and lemon cookies. I want to try different cookies, of course (who wouldn't?), perhaps _M&M cookies or macaron cookies_.
