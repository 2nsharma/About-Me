## Welcome to My Website!


Hello! My name is Nayana Sharma and I am a junior at EBHS high school! I am excited to talk about myself so you can know me better!

The school year is soon ending, summer is arriving and finally, my junior year of high school is coming to a close. A new chapter is opening up in my life, but first -- this website will detail my accomplishments and hobbies-- and more about me!


###                                                     Who Am I? Some Random Facts!

I am a perfectionist at heart because I enjoy doing my very best to achieve the highest quality in all kinds of work--whether it be schoolwork or hobbies. But I've been trying to change myself, operating beyond my ego and need for validation from others. I must say that this year has been a rollercoaster, full of highs and lows. Junior year is a year when I have been learning to get in touch with myself. 

In other words, I've been trying to reduce my stress, and high expectations and pressure I put on myself, by **playing with my dog, Chikoo.**

I am a homebody, which I why home is my favorite place in the world. I dislike traveling for that very reason--especially trips involving long car rides and flights via airplanes. At home, when the skies are dark and filled with rainy clouds, the sounds of thunder rumble as rain patters on my bedroom windows-- I feel like I am at peace. I absolutely love rain, contrary to the dreary, misery, as well as melancholy associated with rain showers.
